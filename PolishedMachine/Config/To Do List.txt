This Game really needs SoundTest Feature.

UI Design
	BG of Mod List will be clouds at the wall
	Option Music will be random, carefully selected by me :D



Toolbox:
	vLabel: Allows you to have text that you do not want the user to change, such as a caption under a graphic.
	vTextBox: Holds text that the user can either enter or change.
			//ComboBox: Allows you to draw a combination list box and text box. The user can either choose an item from the list or enter a value in the text box.
			ListBox: Use to display a list of items from which the user can choose.
				The list can be scrolled if it has more items than can be displayed at one time.
				^(if someone really needs this, they can create own config object using UIconfig)
	vCheckBox: Creates a box that the user can easily choose to indicate if something is true or false,
		or to display multiple choices when the user can choose more than one.
	vOptionButton: Allows you to display multiple choices from which the user can choose only one.
	vRect <== Frame: Allows you to create a graphical or functional grouping for controls.
				To group controls, draw the frame first, and then draw controls inside the frame.
	(can be simulated w/ OpRect) CommandButton: Creates a button the user can choose to carry out a command.
			//TabStrip: Allows you to define multiple pages for the same area of a window or dialog box in your application.
	vMultiPage: Presents multiple screens of information as a single set.
			//ScrollBar: Provides a graphical tool for quickly navigating through a long list of items or a large amount of information,
			for indicating the current position on a scale, or as an input device or indicator of speed or quantity.
			//SpinButton: A spinner control you can use with another control to increment and decrement numbers.
				You can also use it to scroll back and forth through a range of values or a list of items.
	vImage: Displays a graphical image from a bitmap, icon, or metafile on your form.
		Images displayed in an Image control can only be decorative and use fewer resources than a PictureBox.

	vColorPicker: Allows you to choose color.
